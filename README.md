# ðŸš€ GitKraken CLI

`gk` is GitKraken on the command line. The core functionality is focused on "Work Items" which can be thought of as the feature or issue you are trying to tackle. This allows you to work with multiple repos at once and get the same UX as if you were in a monorepo. We also provide robust AI-powered commit messages and Pull Request generation.

GitKraken CLI is available on macOS, Windows, and Unix systems.

## Workflows

Start with a single repo. You can add more later.

In general, your process will look like this:

```bash

# Authenticate
gk auth login

# Navigate to a git repo directory on your filesystem
cd ./path/to/repo

# Then create a Work Item and the current directory
# will be automatically added to the Work Item
gk work create "My new work item"

# Edit files...
# ...

# Commit your changes using AI
gk work commit --ai

# Push your changes
gk work push

# Create a Pull Request
gk work pr create --ai

```

Once you have familiarized yourself with using a single repo, try out creating work items and generating commits and PRs for multiple repos at a time by just adding multiple repos to a new Work Item.

```bash
# Add a repo to the current work item
gk work add ./path/to/repo # path could be as simple as "." if you are in the directory already
```

## `git` Command Passthrough

You can also use `gk` to pass through any `git` command. eg:

```bash
gk status
gk remote -v
# etc
```

## Installation

All binaries can be found on the [releases page][]. Make sure you select the binary for your OS(Linux/Mac/Windows) and CPU architecture (arm64/x86_64/i386).

### macOS

If you have the original GitKraken CLI installed, you can use the following command to upgrade to the latest version:

```bash
brew uninstall gitkraken-cli
```

`gk` is available as a downloadable binary from the [releases page][].

Download it from the [releases page][], unzip it, and add it to your binaries folder:

```bash
sudo mv ~/Downloads/gk /usr/local/bin/gk
```

Then, make sure it's executable:

```bash
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/gk
```

Test the installation by running `gk setup`.

You will likely run into a security error that looks like this:

![](./images/not-opened.png)

To fix this, go to Settings > Security & Privacy > General and click "Allow Anyway".

![](./images/allow-anyway.png)

Try running `gk setup` again and then click "Open Anyway" to continue.

### Unix / Ubuntu

`gk` is available as a downloadable binary from the [releases page][]. Once you have it, add it to your binaries folder:

```bash
mv ~/Downloads/gk /usr/local/bin/gk
```

Or create a new directory, move the binary and add it to $PATH:

```bash
mkdir "$HOME/cli"
mv ~/Downloads/gk "$HOME/cli"
export PATH="$HOME/gk:$PATH"
```

You can also [download][releases page] your corresponding package (`.deb`, `.rpm`) and install it with:

```bash
sudo apt install ./gk.deb
```

or

```bash
sudo rpm -i ./gk.rpm
```

---

### Windows

#### Optional Enable Auto Command Completion

To enable auto-completion for `gk` in PowerShell, follow these steps:

**Create and Save the Install Scripts**
Appendix section with script files:

- [gkcli-update-profile.ps1](#gkcli-update-profileps1)
- [gkcli-uninstall-profile.ps1](#gkcli-uninstall-profileps1)

##### Run the Installer Scripts

- Change to the directory where update-profile.ps1 is located

```sh
cd "C:\Path\To\gkcli-update-profile.ps1"
```

- Run the script to update the profile and sign the auto-completion script

```sh
.\gkcli-update-profile.ps1
```

- Restart PowerShell to apply the changes.

##### Run the Uninstall Script

- Change to the directory where uninstall-profile.ps1 is located

```sh
cd "C:\Path\To\gkcli-uninstall-profile.ps1"
```

- Run the script to remove the auto-completion setup

```sh
.\gkcli-uninstall-profile.ps1
```

- Restart PowerShell to apply the changes.

Or download the binary from the [releases page][] and place the `gk.exe` in a desired folder.
Then edit your environment variables to add it to your PATH.

1. In Search, search for **Environment Variables**.
2. Click on the **Edit the system environment variables** result.
3. In the modal, click on the **Environment Variables...** button.
4. In the **System Variables** section, scroll until you find the **PATH** variable. Click on it.
   - If it doesn't exist, create a variable with the name **PATH**.
5. Add the path to the `gk` binary at the end.

## Troubleshooting

### `gk login` freezes after authenticating in browser

This problem is due to the browser. Currently we know that Safari and Brave do not allow to respond to localhost through port 1314. To fix this, change your default browser or copy the URL before the redirect and open it in another browser.

### gk from Oh-My-Zsh

Oh-My-Zsh has `gitk` aliased as `gk` and that can create some problems. To fix this, type in your terminal:

```
unalias gk
```

## Support

If you encounter any bugs, please submit them to our [Support Portal](https://help.gitkraken.com/gitkraken-desktop/contact-support/).

General feedback and suggestions during testing can be submitted via the "#ambassadors" channel in the [GitKraken Community Slack](https://gitkraken.com/slack) as well as via this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/vAa4x8MaYKWcEdSB8). We will also send a final feedback form at the end of the testing phase.
